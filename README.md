# Endless Void
Endless Void is a science fiction Table Top RPG being developed by Devon Blinston with heavy influence from Pathfinder, Pathfinder Second Edition and Dungeons & Dragons Fifth Edtion.

## Introduction

Welcome to the world of the Endless Void, a sci-fi world set in the midst of vast exploration and colonization in the early 26th century. A frontier full of fledgling colonies, outlaws, tyrants, ancient terrors, incomprehensible horrors and endless adventure is set in front of you.

The sector is a constant ebb and flow of civilization. Many civilizations rise to greatness only to fall to infighting, war or economic collapse. As the current cycle comes to an end the collapsing Hulough Republic has left a vacuum of territory and technology up for grabs and a handful of nations have taken it upon themselves to claim the mantle left behind by the elder rulers of the sector. 

Vast fleets of colony ships spread out from the core worlds of each nation more and more each moment. New colonies pop up and collapse in on themselves daily. Mega-corporations buy up mineral, terraforming and colonizing rights from whatever government claims ownership of the world before sending in vicious mercenaries to claim the territory. Tyrants calling themselves kings wage endless wars on their neighbors to gain what little influence they can with the larger players around them. Outlaws roam the void from colony to colony robbing from the rich and the poor alike, hoping to amass a fortune and retire to a paradise world well away from the horrors of the frontier.

Do you think you can shake off the shackles of your old life, grab the next ship to the frontier and carve out a piece of it for yourself? Will you dive into the chaos and terror of the Void and confront those who would seek to wield their power for evil? Or will you march into the darkness, never to return.
